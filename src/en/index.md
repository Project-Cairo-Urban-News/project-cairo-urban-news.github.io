Welcome to the News of Cairo! In this site you can find a textual database of selected Arabic (and some Ottoman Turkish) articles about Cairo's urban development from al-Waqāʾiʿ al-Miṣriyyah, the official Egyptian government journal, between 1828 and 1914. There are three ways you can start to use this dataset: 1) search in the searchbox 2) check the index of organizations, roles, locations 3) check the Timeline page and click according to year.
